# reverse shell obfuscated for windows

designed to run on a target machine for the purpose of establishing reverse network communication with an attacking machine. When the script is run on the target machine, it initiates an outbound connection to the IP address and port specified in the code. A connected machine, which is waiting for a connection, receives this reverse connection request and establishes two-way communication.

Once the connection is established, the operator of the attacking machine has full control over the target machine. This allows executing commands, downloading files, exploiting the system and carrying out various malicious activities depending on the target machine's permissions and capabilities.
